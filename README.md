List of libre (free and open-source) fonts on GitHub available under licenses such as SIL OFL and Apache. I might include samples too.

This list is designed to be similar to Lee Reilly's list of [Games](https://github.com/leereilly/games) on GitHub, so feel free to fork and pull request as I want this list to ideally be exhaustive.

## Serif

* [IBM Plex Serif](https://github.com/IBM/type)

## Sans-serif

* [IBM Plex Sans](https://github.com/IBM/type)
* [Overpass](https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass) - Based on Highway Gothic, replacement for Interstate.

## Monospaced
